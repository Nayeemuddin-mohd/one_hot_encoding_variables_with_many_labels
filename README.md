# one_hot_encoding_variables_with_many_labels

# one hot encoding of top variables

#Advantages

Straightforward to implement

Does not require hrs of varibale exploration

Does not expand massively the feature space(number of columns in the dataset)

# Disadvantages

Does not add any information that may make the variable more predictive

Does not keep the information of the ignored labels

Because it is not unusual that categorical variables have a few dominating categories and the remaining and the remaining labels add mostly noise, this is a quite simple and straightforward approach that may be useful on many occasions.

it is worth nothing that the top 10 variables is a totally arbitary number. you could also choose the top 5 or top 20.
